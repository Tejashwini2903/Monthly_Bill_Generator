# Monthly_Bill_Generator

## Overview

The *Monthly Billing Generator* is a Python-based tool that calculates itemized bills for a given month based on usage data (start date, end date, rate, and quantity). It handles partial-month usage by prorating charges and groups billing details by item code and usage period. The system outputs a structured summary of all charges and total revenue.

- *Grouped Line Items*: Aggregates items by code, rate, and billing period.
